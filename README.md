# Introduction
TBD
# Background
This project was crafted to provide hands-on experience with SQL queries, data analysis techniques and gain practical skills in SQL while exploring various dimensions of space missions, including their frequency, costs, success rates, and temporal patterns, using real-world data related to space exploration. üöÄ

üîç All used queries in: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

### Areas for analysis I wanted to cover are:

1. Basic statistics
2. Financial
3. Mission Successes
4. Temporal
5. Rockets
6. Combined analysis

# Tools I used

- **SQL:** The basis of my analysis, allowing me to query the database.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Chosen IDE for executing SQL queries and managing database.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.
- **Python:** For converting .csv file for suitable encoding and plotting graphs based on received query.
- **Power BI:** Used for creating understandable report.

# 1. Basic Statistics
***Number of space missions conducted by each company:***
This metric represents the total count of space missions attributed to each company, providing insight into the activity levels of various aerospace firms.

***Number of space missions conducted from each location:*** This measure indicates the number of space missions launched from various locations, highlighting geographical trends and launch site usage.

***Number of space missions in each year:*** This analysis examines the annual count of space missions, offering a year-by-year overview of space exploration activity.
# 2. Financial Analysis
***Total cost of missions for each company:*** This metric sums up the total expenditure on space missions conducted by each company, providing an overview of the financial investment by different firms.

***Average cost of missions:*** This calculation determines the average cost of a single space mission, offering a general sense of the typical expenses involved.

***Most expensive and least expensive mission:*** This identifies the space mission with the highest cost and the one with the lowest cost, highlighting the extremes of mission expenditures.
# 3. Mission Success Analysis
***Percentage of successful rocket launches:*** This analysis measures the overall success rate of rocket launches for each company by comparing the number of successful launches to the total number of company's launches.
# 4. Temporal Analysis
***Number of space launch in each month:*** This metric displays the count of space launch conducted during each month of the year, providing a monthly breakdown of mission activity.

***Most active month in terms of number of launch:*** This analysis identifies the month with the highest number of space launch, indicating the peak period of space mission activity.
# 5. Rocket Analysis
***Number of launch for each rocket:*** This metric displays the count of launch conducted using each specific rocket, highlighting their utilization.

***Most frequently used rocket:*** This analysis identifies the rocket that has been used the most often, indicating its prominence and reliability in space missions.
# 6. Combined Analyses
***Number of launch conducted by each company from each location:*** This metric displays the count of launch conducted by each company from various launch locations, providing insight into the geographical distribution of their activities.

***Average cost of successful and unsuccessful launch:*** This analysis compares the average cost of launch that were successful with those that were unsuccessful, highlighting cost differences based on launch outcomes.

***Oldest rocket which is still on duty:***
This metric displays the oldest rocket that is still in service, showing its 'on duty time' and providing insight into its operational longevity.

***Important dates of each retired rocket***
This metric shows the first and last launch dates, as well as the duration and count of launch for which each rocket remained active, providing a comprehensive timeline of its operational history.
